C ASN.1 library README
----------------------

This directory contains the type definitions and the encode, decode,
free and print routines for all of the built-in ASN.1 types.  It also
contains the code for three different buffer types.

The makefile will produce 3 different libraries, one for each buffer
type.  Each buffer types requires a different library because many of
the buffer routine calls made from the encode and decode library
routines are macros (for performance reasons).

The 3 libararies are:
        libasn1cebuf.a - uses the ExpBufs
        libasn1cmbuf.a - uses the MinBufs
        libasn1csbuf.a - uses the SBufs

See the documentation for a full descriptions of the buffer types.
You must link your code with proper library (i.e. if you use SBufs,
link with libasn1csbuf.a).
