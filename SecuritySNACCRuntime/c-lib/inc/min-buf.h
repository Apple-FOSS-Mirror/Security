 * .../c-lib/inc/min-buf.h - trivial buffer routines.
 *             only use these for
 *                encoding - if you know you 'buffer' is big enough
 *                            to hold the encoded value
 *
 *                decoding - if you know that the encoding is error
 *                           free.
 *
 *
 * The minimal buffer is simply a block of mem referenced
 * by a char **(ie BUF_TYPE char**).  These are very efficient
 * but should only be used when it is safe (see above) or you're
 * willing to risk reading past the end of the buffer or writing
 * 'past' the beginning (segmentation faults/bus errors etc).
 *
 * No checks for reading or writing past the buffer are done.
 * every operation is assumed to succeed.
