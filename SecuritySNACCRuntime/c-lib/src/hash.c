/*
 * This was borrowed from Don Acton and Terry Coatta's Raven Code.
 * It has been modified somewhat.
 *    - Mike Sample 92
 *
 * This is a set or routines that implements an extensible hashing
 * algorithm. At the moment it assumes that all the hash codes are unique
 * (ie. there are no collisions). For the way hash codes are currently being
 * supplied this is not a bad assumption.
 * The extensible hashing routine used is based on a multiway tree with
 * each node in the tree being a fixed array of (2^n) size. At a given
 * level, i, in the tree with the first level being level 0, bits
 * i*n through i*n through (i+1)*n-1 are used as the index into the table.
 * Each entry in the table is either NULL (unused) or a pointer to an
 * object of type entry. The entry contains all the information about a
 * hash entry. The entry also contains a field indicating whether or not this
 * is a leaf node. If an entry isn't a leaf node then it references a table at
 * at the next level and not a value. With the current implementation
 * a 32 hash value is used and table sizes are 256. The algorithm used
 * here is the same as the one used in the Set class of the Raven
 * class system.
