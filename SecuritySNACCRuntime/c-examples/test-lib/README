C test_lib README
-----------------

This directory should have 3 files:
        README - this file
        makefile
        test_lib.c

Type "make" to compile test_lib.

test_lib tests each encode and decode routine in the C ASN.1
runtime library. Errors will be reported.

test_lib should be run for each machine architecture you install snacc on.
If you modify the library routines you should run test_lib again.

The general testing methodology is:
        1. test the buffer routines
        2. test tags
        3. test lengths
        4. test each libarary type.

For each type, a range of values is encoded and then decoded
and and compared with the original value.
