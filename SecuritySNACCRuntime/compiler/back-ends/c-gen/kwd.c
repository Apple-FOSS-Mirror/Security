 * $Log: kwd.c,v $
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/18 23:14:09  mb
 * Move from private repository to open source repository
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/05/05 00:59:28  rmurphy
 * Adding darwin license headers
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/05/10 21:35:02  rmurphy
 * Adding back in base code files which had been moved to "2" versions.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1999/03/16 18:06:43  aram
 * Originals from SMIME Free Library.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1995/07/25 18:45:38  rj
 * file name has been shortened for redundant part: c-gen/c-kwd -> c-gen/kwd.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1994/10/08  03:48:06  rj
 * since i was still irritated by cpp standing for c++ and not the C preprocessor, i renamed them to cxx (which is one known suffix for C++ source files). since the standard #define is __cplusplus, cplusplus would have been the more obvious choice, but it is a little too long.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/09/01  00:20:28  rj
 * snacc_config.h removed; more portable .h file inclusion.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/08/28  09:48:13  rj
 * first check-in. for a list of changes to the snacc-1.1 distribution please refer to the ChangeLog.
