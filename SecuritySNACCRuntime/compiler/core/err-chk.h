 * Revision 1.1  2001/06/20 21:27:56  dmitch
 * Adding missing snacc compiler files.

 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1999/03/16 18:06:47  aram
 * Originals from SMIME Free Library.

 * Revision 1.3  1995/07/25 19:41:26  rj
 * changed `_' to `-' in file names.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/10/08  03:48:42  rj
 * since i was still irritated by cpp standing for c++ and not the C preprocessor, i renamed them to cxx (which is one known suffix for C++ source files). since the standard #define is __cplusplus, cplusplus would have been the more obvious choice, but it is a little too long.

 * Revision 1.1  1994/08/28  09:49:07  rj
 * first check-in. for a list of changes to the snacc-1.1 distribution please refer to the ChangeLog.
