/*
 * compiler/core/exports.h -
 *
 *      ExportElmt list set up during  parse.
 *      (not kept in Module data struct)
 *
 *  SetExports runs through type, value & macro defs and sets the
 *  exports flag accordingly.
 *
 *  the exportsParsed boolean means whether the symbol "EXPORTS"
 *  was parsed - since if EXPORTS was parsed and the export list
 *  is empty, NOTHING is exported, otherwise if the "EXPORTS"
 *  symbol was not parsed (export list is empty) then EVERYTHING
 *  is exported

 * Revision 1.1  2001/06/20 21:27:56  dmitch
 * Adding missing snacc compiler files.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1999/03/16 18:06:48  aram
 * Originals from SMIME Free Library.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/10/08 03:48:43  rj
 * since i was still irritated by cpp standing for c++ and not the C preprocessor, i renamed them to cxx (which is one known suffix for C++ source files). since the standard #define is __cplusplus, cplusplus would have been the more obvious choice, but it is a little too long.

 * Revision 1.1  1994/08/28  09:49:09  rj
 * first check-in. for a list of changes to the snacc-1.1 distribution please refer to the ChangeLog.
