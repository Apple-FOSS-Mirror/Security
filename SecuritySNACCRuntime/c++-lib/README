C++ ASN.1 library README
------------------------

This directory contains the class definitions and the encode, decode,
free and print methods for all of the built-in ASN.1 types.  It also
contains buffer routines.

The makefile will produce one or two libraries, libasn1c++.a and
libasn1tcl.a.
Whether the tcl library is to be generated or not is determined at
configuration time.

In addition to the normal C++ libraries contents, the Tcl library
contains the meta code and the Tcl interface described in the
documentation.
