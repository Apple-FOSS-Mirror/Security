                 MacOS X Porting notes

-- snacc.pbproj contains the following targets:

	world: aggregate target, builds UnixBuild and snaccRuntime
	
	UnixBuild: Legacy target, invokes MacOSX-Install, a custom
		script to config and build the snacc compiler and the 
		Unix versions of the various libraries. This does not install
		the snacc binary; maybe it should. 
	  
		Due to many brain dead Makefiles, this target always rebuilds
		a ton of stuff even if nothing has changed. Feel free to rewrite
		all the Makefiles to fix this.
	  
   snaccRuntime: builds the runtime support library as an OSX
      framework using the same source as c++-lib. Currently 
	  obsolete; this is now part of Security.framework. 
	  
-- There are a few header files which have duplicate copies
   in the snacc-1.3vda root directory and in c++-lib/inc. They're
   needed in the root by the compiler build and various configure
   operations, and neneded in c++lib for the framework built
   there (snaccRuntime.framework). The headers are needed by
   other headers installed in that framework. A non-trivial 
   amount of Makefile and configure.in hacking could eliminate
   the need for maintaining duplicate copies of these files.
   Be my guest.  One header, config.h, is generated at configure
   time and is subsequently copied into the c++-lib/inc directory
   by the MacOSX-Install script. The other headers are policy.h 
   and snacc.h, which change rarely. 
   
-- The following examples are skipped during the build all.

    c++-examples.simple - runtime failure
	c-examples/snmp - runtime failure
	tbl-example - runtime failure
	tcl-example - build failure
	
-- When running the snacc compiler to generate C++ source, you 
   must specify the (undocumented) -D argument to enable VDADER_RULES. 
   When compiling that source, you must do a -DVDADER_RULES.
