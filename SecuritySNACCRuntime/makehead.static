# Revision 1.1  2000/12/22 00:01:14  dmitch
# New file, included by most makefiles here and below, due to apparently broken autoconf, which now generates empty makehead file. This one is a copy of the last makehead which worked.
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/06/15 18:50:16  dmitch
# Doc change only.
#
# Revision 1.1.1.1  1999/03/16 18:05:49  aram
# Originals from SMIME Free Library.
#
# Revision 1.7  1997/02/16 16:44:50  rj
# made return *this after calling abort()'' a compile time option.
#
# Revision 1.6  1995/09/07  18:38:39  rj
# PSBOOK and PSNUP added. (they get used in .../doc/makefile)
#
# manext and mandir split into two pairs, for sections 1 and n.
#
# Revision 1.5  1995/07/24  14:59:35  rj
# new macros added:
#  libexecdir for architecture-specific stuff
#  tcldir under libdir (architecture independent)
#  TCLSH
#  DEPENDENCIES for c*-lib's multiple dependencies via recursive make calls
#  TREELIBS for tree-3.6 widget libs
#  PATCH for c-lib to patch tbl.h
#  TCL-P utility prog that returns whether the tcl interface should be made as exit code
#
# Revision 1.4  1995/02/18  11:53:46  rj
# added a small hack to find gcc's hidden include directory to pass it to makedepend. this shall enable X11's makedepend to find .h files a little more the way gcc does.
#
# Revision 1.3  1995/02/13  14:53:58  rj
# CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS moved from the various makefiles to here.
#
# Revision 1.2  1994/10/08  04:30:32  rj
# Tcl and X11 libs added
#
# Revision 1.1  1994/09/01  00:51:23  rj
# first check-in (new file).
