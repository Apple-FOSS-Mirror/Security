.SH NAME
ptbl \- print a type table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
ptbl [\-a] <tbl-file>
.SH DESCRIPTION

ptbl prints the give type table to stdout.  It will print it in one of
two formats: internal style and ASN.1 stlye.  The internal style shows
the contents of the type table data structure in ASN.1 value notation.
You will need to look at the tbl.asn1 file to understand the internal
form.  The ASN.1 form attempts to re-create the ASN.1 that generated
the given type table.
