.SH NAME
mkchdr \- creates a C header file from a type table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mkchdr <tbl-file> [output-file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
mkchdr will generate a C header file from the given type table.  The C
data structures will be written to the given output file.  If an
output file is not given, the C header is written to stdout.

The generated C data structure is the value representation that table
driven encoder expects (and decoder returns) for the type definitions
in the given type table.  The table driven encoder and decoder, etc.
routines do not use the generated header - they treat the data in a
generic way.  The generated header file simply saves you the hassle of
dealing with ASN.1 values in the same generic way.  Instead you get
properly named structs and field names.  You do not need to use mkchdr
to use the table driven encoders etc. but it is recommended.
