/* The engine which performs the actual authentication and authorization computations.

	The implementation of a typical call to AuthorizationCreate would look like:
	
	Get the current shared CredentialSet for this session.
	Call authorizedRights() with inRights and the shared CredentialSet.
	Compute the difference set between the rights requested and the rights returned from authorizedRights().  
	Call credentialIds() with the rights computed above (for which we have no credentials yet).
	Call aquireCredentials() for the credentialIds returned from credentialIds()
	For each credential returned place it in the session (replacing when needed) if shared() returns true.
	The authorization returned to the user should now refer to the credentials in the session and the non shared ones returned by aquireCredentials().

	When a call to AuthorizationCopyRights() is made, just call authorizedRights() using the union of the session credentials and the credentials tied to the authorization specified.

	When a call to AuthorizationCopyInfo() is made, ask the Credential specified by tag for it info and return it.

	When a call to AuthorizationFree() is made, delete all the non-shared credentials ascociated with the authorization specified.  If the kAuthorizationFreeFlagDestroy is set.  Also delete the shared credentials ascociated with the authorization specified.
