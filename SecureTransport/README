                     SecureTransport notes                       8 Nov 1999 dmitch                       Current status of this project:Note "Version" refers to SSL2 vs. SSL3. "Mode" refers to client vs. server.-- All modes require domestic CSP. -- Both modes require post-Sonata CSP mods which allow    specification of raw symmetric key bits. These CSP changes    have been checked in prior to 8 Nov 1999.-- Server mode requires post-Sonata CSP mods which allow    asymmetric keys to have multiple KeyUsage flags set -    specifically, private keys must be able to sign and    decrypt; public keys must be able to verify and encrypt.   These CSP changes have NOT been checked in as of 8 Nov 1999;   final implementation pending input from A. Perez. -- Client mode works in both versions, both domestic and export. -- Server mode works with Netscape client 4.6.1 on Mac.    Operation with IE on Mac is flaky - sometimes it works,   sometimes not. Server untested with Windows clients. -- Client authentication is not tested. -- No support for session resumption. This needs a thread-safe   database, to be implemented in appleSession.c.
