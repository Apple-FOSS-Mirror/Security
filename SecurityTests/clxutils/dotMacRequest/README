8/21/05

Request with live server now working. Use a real paid account.

To request a cert

dotMacRequest i -u dmitch77 -k dotMacKeychain.keychain -Z <<...dot mac password here>>

To revoke, go to www.mac.com, log in, click your account name in upper right, authenticate
again, click "Secure iChat" in lower right, revoke the cert. You have to log out and log 
back in each time you do this in order to see a newly generated cert after you revoke one.

Request and renew work as of 7/25/05. 
Renew requires the same key pair as the original, so:
  -- renew only works when your current cert really is still current
  -- run with -p (pick key pair) to select correct key pair
  -- must delete old/current cert before running since the old 
     and new certs have the same DB attrs.
