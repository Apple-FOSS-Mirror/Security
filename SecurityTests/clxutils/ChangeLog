As of April 9 2003, the clxutils directory will be tagged 
with the version of Security.framework with which the 
particular version of clxutils works. When a change
is introduced into clxutils which prevents the tests
from building or running with previous version of Security,
an entry will be made in this file and the whole directory
will be tagged with the same tag as the version of Security
needed to run with the current version of clxutils. 

Addenda: tags are now of the form clxutils-XXX since the Security reorg.
