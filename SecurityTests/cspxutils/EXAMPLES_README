                        CDSA Sample Code Info

Introduction
------------
This directory contains three programs which demonstrate how to 
write code using the Common Data Security Architecture (CDSA) 
API.

Building
--------

To build all of the examples, open a Terminal window, cd to the 
CDSA_Examples directory, and type 'make'. If the LOCAL_BUILD_DIR 
environment variable is set, the executables are placed there; 
otherwise they are built in place in the respective directories.

Source code
-----------
There are four directories in this package. Three contain the 
source for three executables themselves - rsatool, dhTest, and 
cryptTool. The fourth is utilLib, which contains a superset of 
the code which the three examples need to link against. The only 
two files in utilLib of interest for the purpose of these example are:

common.c - setup and initialize CSSM and CSP (see cspDlDbStartup())
cspwrap.c - wrapper functions for some of the crypto operations,
like generate key pair (cspGenKeyPair()), encryption
(cspEncrypt()), and decryption (cspDecrypt()). 

See the README files in the respective directories for more 
information.
