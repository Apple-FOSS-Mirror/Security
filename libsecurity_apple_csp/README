                   libsecurity_apple_csp Notes
				   
To build this project in a Darwin environment (as opposed to building in-house
at Apple), use the Darwin buildstyle. If you're building with Xcode, select
"Darwin" from the "Active Build Style" popup. If you're building from the command
line, specify the build style like so:

% xcodebuild -buildstyle Darwin install

This build style is necessitated by the fact that the CSP built at (and 
shipped by) Apple includes some algorithms which are proprietary to Apple;
the source code for these algorithms is not open source. Selecting the 
Darwin build style allows the CSP (and hence Security.framework, which also
must be built with the Darwin build style) to be built from the Darwin 
open source tree without requiring the source for these algorithms. 

The algorithms avoided by selecting the Darwin build style are as follows:

CSSM_ALGID_ASC
   Apple Secure Compression, a symmetric encryption algorithm
   which performs simultaneous encryption and compression.
   
CSSM_ALGID_FEE
CSSM_ALGID_FEED
CSSM_ALGID_FEEDEXP
CSSM_ALGID_FEE_MD5
CSSM_ALGID_FEE_SHA1
CSSM_ALGID_SHA1WithECDSA
CSSM_ALGID_ECDSA
   Asymmetric encryption using Apple's patented Fast Elliptic Encryption 
   algorithm.
