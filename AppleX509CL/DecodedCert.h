/*
 * DecodedCert.h - object representing a snacc-decoded cert, with extensions
 * parsed and decoded (still in snacc format).
 *
 * Created 9/1/2000 by Doug Mitchell. 
 * Copyright (c) 2000 by Apple Computer. 
 *
 * This object is how we store certs, both when caching them (explicitly or
 * during a search), and as an intermediate stage during template (TBS, or
 * to-be-signed cert) construction. This is a subclass of the SNACC-generated class
 * Certificate; the main functionality we add is the parsing and decoding of 
 * Extensions. Extensions are not decoded in class Certificate beyond the level
 * of the X.509 Extension object, which just contains the ID (an OID), the
 * critical flag, and an octet string containing an ID-specific thing. 
 *
 * When we decode a cert or a TBS, we also parse the Extension objects, decoding
 * then into specific SNACC classes like KeyUsage or BasicConstriantsSyntax. We
 * keep these decoded extensions in a list of DecodedExten structs. GetCertField
 * ops which access extensions access these DecodedExten structs.
 *
 * When creating a cert template (TBS), each incoming field associated with an 
 * extension is translated into an object like a (SNACC) KeyUsage and stored in
 * our DecodedExten list. 
 *
 * When encoding a TBS, we BER-encode each of the SNACC objects (KeyUsage, etc.) 
 * in our list of DecodedExtens, wrapthe result in an Octet string (actually an
 * AsnOcts) and store it in the SNACC-generated CertificateToSign's extensions
 * list. 
 *
 * Support for extensions which we don't understand is handled as follows. When
 * setting cert fields for such extensions during template construction, the app 
 * has to BER-encode the underlying extension. We just wrap this in an octet string
 * (AsnOcts) and store the result in a DecodedExten without further ado. When 
 * encoding the TBS, this octet string is just copied into the CertificateToSign's 
 * Extension list without further ado. When decoding a cert, if we find an 
 * extension we don't understand, the SNACC object stored in the DecodedExten 
 * is just a copy of the AsnOcts (which is the BER encoding of the underlying 
 * mystery extension wrapped in an Octet string). We pass back the Octet string's 
 * contents (*not* the BER-encoded octet string) during a GetCertField op.
