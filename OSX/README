This code contains a Darwin version of CDSA along with many other security libraries.

Information about CDSA may be obtained from the OpenGroup web site at:

To build this project in a Darwin environment (as opposed to building in-house
at Apple), use the Darwin buildstyle. If you're building with Xcode, select
"Darwin" from the "Active Build Style" popup. If you're building from the command
line, specify the build style like so:

% xcodebuild -buildstyle Darwin install

This build style is necessitated by the fact that the CSP built at (and 
shipped by) Apple includes some algorithms which are proprietary to Apple;
the source code for these algorithms is not open source. Selecting the 
Darwin build style allows the Security project (and also the CSP, in 
the libsecurity_apple_csp project, which also must be built with the 
Darwin build style) to be built from the Darwin open source tree without 
requiring the source for these algorithms.
